## 2. Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do not open a public issue.**  
   Security issues must be reported privately.

2. Contact me directly at: **davidedc@outlook.com**  
   (or via GitHub private security advisory, if preferred).

3. Include as much detail as possible:
   - Affected version(s)
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact

## 3. Responsible Disclosure

I kindly ask that you:

- Give me a reasonable time to investigate and patch before public disclosure.
- Avoid exploiting the vulnerability beyond what‚Äôs necessary for proof of concept.
- Coordinate with me on the disclosure timeline.
